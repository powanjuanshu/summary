-r 这个标记被用来创建一个系统用户.且uid低于500,且没有home目录

-r This flag is used to create a system account. That  is,  a  user
              with   a  UID  lower  than  the  value  of  UID_MIN  defined  in
              /etc/login.defs and whose password does not  expire.  Note  that
              useradd  will  not  create  a  home  directory for such an user,
              regardless of the default setting in /etc/login.defs.  You  have
              to  specify  -m option if you want a home directory for a system
              account to be created.  This is an option added by Red Hat.
